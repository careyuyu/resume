\datedsubsection{\textbf{PONS Incorporated}, NJ, U.S.A (remote)}{Jan. 2023 -- Present}
\role{Software Engineer}{}
Brief introduction: Led and managed the development of the \textbf{AWS-CDK} based back-end services in \textbf{serverless model} and front-end applications in \textbf{Flutter} for an AI-driven remote medical ultrasound imaging solution.
\begin{itemize}
\item Contributed to converting the core image enhancement algorithm from \textbf{Matlab} to \textbf{Python} for seamless deployment in \textbf{AWS serverless model}. Created a stable \textbf{Docker} image of the modified algorithm and efficiently managed and deployed it using \textbf{AWS ECS} and \textbf{AWS Fargate}. Achieved a reduction in average execution time from 8.7 seconds to 3.7 seconds by optimizing Fargate service settings.
\item Managed the integration of the system with major \textbf{EMR (Electronic Medical Record)} platforms in the U.S. by thoroughly studying their API documentations and implementing essential \textbf{AWS microservices}. Implemented handlers for \textbf{OAuth} login to EMRs, \textbf{APIs} for seamless data retrieval from EMRs, and a reliable \textbf{EMR JWT token validator service}, significantly enhancing system functionality and security.
\item Implemented a streamlined service utilizing \textbf{DynamoDB streams} and \textbf{AWS SES} for generating and dispatching scan appointment QR codes to patients via e-mail. Simplified the use of the service.
\item Collaborated with the ML team to successfully migrate the training and deployment of model endpoints to \textbf{AWS SageMaker}, ensuring efficient integration with AWS services.
\end{itemize}

\datedsubsection{\textbf{PONS Incorporated}, NJ, U.S.A (remote)}{Jul. 2022 -- Dec. 2022}
\role{Software Engineer Intern}{}
\begin{itemize}
\item Developed and deployed \textbf{AWS CDK}-based microservices on \textbf{AWS} for scan events handling (core service) encompassing smooth scan file upload and download to \textbf{S3}, efficient \textbf{DynamoDB} indexing, and reliable \textbf{AWS Lambda} functions for API handlers and inter-service communication.
\item Developed the company's core tablet and web app using \textbf{Flutter} based on Figma design, incorporating a \textbf{robust and shareable widget library}. Integrated backend APIs to facilitate efficient uploading and viewing of scan files. Received positive feedback from investors and testers.
\item Collaborated with ML team and ultrasound device provider, integrated the ultrasound scanning device SDK and \textbf{PyTorch models} into the \textbf{Flutter app}, enabling real-time scan instructions to patients using video frames from the ultrasound device and the ML model (key product feature).
\end{itemize}

\datedsubsection{\textbf{3D Optical Information Lab}, Virginia Tech, U.S.A}{Sept. 2018 -- May. 2019}
\role{Undergraduate Research Assistant}{}
\begin{itemize}
\item Contributed to the development of a pipeline of computer vision algorithms to extract crack patterns from a large volumetric data of in-situ X-ray tomography measurements using \textbf{Python and TensorFlow}.
\end{itemize}
